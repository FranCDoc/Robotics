# Mobile Robotics Competition. 

The problem was inspired by the “Eurobot” contest. 

1. The objective of the robot was to grab and bring back targets to its team base. Different modules such as localization, path-planning and low-level control have been implemented. 

2. The mobile robot controller was programmed in C++. The employed simulation environment was Robotran. 

3. This challenge was the final assignment of "LMECA2732 - Robotics" given in Université Catholique de Louvain.
